# RotableVideoControl

I was looking for a solution to rotate a video without rotating its controls.

The only useful resource was [this](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos).
Well, it did not have what I wanted but gave me a clue of making a custom video control.

# What I've done

- [X] Video content is rotable with a fixed height size container.
- [X] Video controls are not rotated along with the video content.
- [X] Video controls are responsive.
- [X] Enable to loop videos.

# Compatibility

- [X] Google Chrome

# Todo

- [ ] Support fixed width size container

# Demo
