# RotatableVideoControl

I was looking for a solution to rotate a video without rotating its controls and ended up with nothing.

The only useful resource was [this](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos).
Well, it did not have what I wanted but gave me a clue about making a custom video control.

So I have created one, which was based on [this](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos), fitting my needs.

# Todo

- [X] Video content is rotable with a fixed height size container.
- [X] Video controls are not rotated along with the video content.
- [X] Video controls are responsive.
- [X] Enable to loop videos.
- [X] Any setting change on a video will affect all videos on the same page.
- [ ] Support fixed width size container.
- [ ] Improve CSS for a higher stability.
