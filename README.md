# HTMLVideoTag

I was looking for a solution to rotate a video without its controls.

The only useful resource was [this](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos).
However, it still does not work as I expected though.

# Todo

Improve the video content's rotation ability.
